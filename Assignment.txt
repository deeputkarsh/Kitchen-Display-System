Kitchen Display System

Dalviroo is hypothetical  an on-demand food delivery company and our operations revolve around that single concept. Our Stores receive a daily prediction of sales numbers, which in turn help us pre-prep the food before usual rush. And help us decide how much of each raw material needs to be in ready state. We want to display these numbers in a simple report that is accessible via browser but that can also be displayed on a large screen in the kitchen. For every order that is created, workers on kitchen display mark it as “done” which automatically increase “created-till-now” column for that product

Sample Kitchen Display


Name 				Quantity 	Created-till-now 	Predicted 	Status
Jumbo Chicken Wrap	1 			14 					123 		DONE ( button )
Vegetarian Lasagne 	2 			23 					456 		DONE ( button )



Sample Report

Dish name				Produced 	Predicted
Jumbo Chicken Wrap:		17			123
Vegetarian Lasagne:		38			456
Chicken Rice Feast:		21			1230
Grilled Chicken Breast:	67			1435

We want you to create a this kitchen display as a scalable infrastructure using code, that exposes following functionality

API to place an order with quantity, upon which the product is appended to the kitchen display system page



API for Setting up Predicted values for each dish



Created-till-now = products * quantity , marked as done till now



Letting you download reports, like the sample report  mentioned



Create a html page, for kitchen display, that can be opened in multiple places and each page is automatically synced when DONE is clicked



Upload this code on either Heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean or Linode and give us a working link . We would open this kitchen display page on multiple tabs and test the above said functionality.



Create a code in one of the languages  Python, Ruby, Node.js that facilitates creation of such Kitchen display system. You would be judged on following


Code



Scalability of solution



Understanding of code written



Code readability
